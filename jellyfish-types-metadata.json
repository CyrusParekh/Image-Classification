You can apply ML techniques to gain insights into jellyfish classification, species identification, and color analysis. \n\n\u0026gt;1. **Moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita)**: Common jellyfish with four horseshoe-shaped gonads visible through the top of its translucent bell. It feeds by collecting medusae, plankton, and mollusks with its tentacles.\n2. **Barrel jellyfish (Rhizostoma pulmo)**: Largest jellyfish found in British waters, with a bell that can grow up to 90 cm in diameter. It feeds on plankton and small fish by catching them in its tentacles.\n3. **Blue jellyfish (Cyanea lamarckii)**: Large jellyfish that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. It feeds on plankton and small fish by catching them in its tentacles.\n4. **Compass jellyfish (Chrysaora hysoscella)**: Named after the brown markings on its bell that resemble a compass rose. It feeds on plankton and small fish by catching them in its tentacles.\n5. **Lion\u2019s mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata)**: Largest jellyfish in the world, with a bell that can grow up to 2 meters in diameter and tentacles that can reach up to 30 meters in length. It feeds on plankton and small fish by catching them in its tentacles.\n6. M**auve stinger (Pelagia noctiluca)**: Small jellyfish with long tentacles and warty structures on its bell full of stinging cells. It feeds on other small jellyfish and oceanic sea squirts.\n\n\n# Use Cases\n\n\u0026gt;- **Jellyfish classification**: Use machine learning techniques to classify jellyfish images into different categories based on their physical characteristics.\n- **Species identification**: Use machine learning techniques to identify the species of jellyfish in your dataset based on their physical characteristics.\n- **Color analysis**: Use machine learning techniques to analyze the color patterns of jellyfish in your dataset.\n\n"}
