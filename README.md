# Image-Classification

Introduction: The purpose of this project is to choose an image dataset and then develop an image classification algorithm using a neural network.

Data: This project uses the fashion_mnist dataset. It's comprised of 28 x 28 grayscale images spanning 10 types (classes) of clothing.

Data Analysis Steps
1. Loading data with train test split
2. Converting image data to a one-dimensional array
3. Normalization
4. Defining the neural network model and setting hyperparamters
5. Initializing the tuner and examining the results
6. Examining accuracy and the confusion matrix for the best-performing model
